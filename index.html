<tr><td>Submitted by user iosborn22. Blue morpho butterflys wings are bright blue, edged 
with black. Blue morpho is among the largest butterflies in the world, with wings spanning
from five to eight inches. When blue morpho flies, the contrasting bright blue and dull brown
colors flash, making it look like the morpho is appearing and disappearing.</td></tr>
